<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> is a graphical front-end to the LIGPLOT and
DIMPLOT programs. The plots generated by these programs can be
interactively edited on screen and then written to a PostScript file
for printing or conversion to various image formats. Additionally, you
can superpose related LIGPLOTs/DIMPLOTs to highlight similarities and
differences between related proteins binding the same/similar ligand,
or the same/similar ligand binding to different proteins.

<ul>
<li><B>LIGPLOT</B> - automatically generates schematic diagrams of
protein-ligand interactions for a given ligand in a PDB file.

<li><B>DIMPLOT</B> - plots interactions across a selected protein-protein or
domain-domain interface.

<li><B>Antibody plot</B> - plots antibody/antigen interactions,
showing which antibody loops are involved.
</ul>

The very first time you run LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> after installation, you
will need to define several paths and directories so that the program
knows where to find things like PDB files, the Het Group Dictionary
and the RasMol/PyMOL programs (if you have them). LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> will
detect that it is being run for the first time and will pop up an
entry-form, described in the section below, for you to fill in.

<h3>2. Paths and directories</h3>

The entry-form for defining paths and directories looks as shown below.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="paths_form.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
Edit the text fields as follows:

<P>
<B>i. PDB paths</B><BR>

PDB files are most conveniently identified simply by the 4-character
PDB code or identifier. If your system contains one or more locations
where PDB files are stored, you can define a "template" path which
will allow LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> to find the relevant PDB file
from its 4-character code alone. The files can be gzipped or not.

<P>
Alternatively, if you are connected to the internet when you run
LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP>, the required file can be retrieved by ftp
from a given ftp site.

<P>
The 4 characters of the PDB code in each template are represented as
<font color=green><B>abcd</B></font>. These appear in the template
within square brackets.

<P>
For example, the template

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color=green><B>C:/roman/pdbsum/pdb/pdb[abcd].ent</B></font>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

means that, for example, PDB code <B>1ral</B> would be translated as:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>C:/roman/pdbsum/pdb/pdb1ral.ent</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Similarly, the ftp template

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color=green><B>ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/rcsb/pdb-remediated/data/structures/divided/pdb/[bc]/pdb[abcd].ent.gz</B></font>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

would map to PDB code <B>1ral</B> as:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/rcsb/pdb-remediated/data/structures/divided/pdb/ra/pdb1ral.ent.gz</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that here the PDB files are stored in subdirectories whose names
correspond to the middle part of the PDB code (here shown as
"<B>[bc]</B>").

<P>
The above ftp address retrieves gzipped PDB files from the PDBe ftp
site at the EBI. A full list of possible ftp addresses is given below:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <B>PDBe</B>
  </td>
  <td>
   &nbsp; &nbsp;

  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>

  <td>
   <font color=green><B>ftp://ftp.pdbj.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/divided/pdb/[bc]/pdb[abcd].ent.gz</B></font>
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>

  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

You can add others if you wish.

<P>
<B>ii. The Het Group Dictionary</B><BR>

LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> gets its information about ligand molecules
from the Het Group Dictionary. This defines the atom names,
connectivities and bond orders of every Het Group in the PDB. You can
download a copy of this dictionary from the <B>wwPDB</B> at:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a href="ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/components.cif"><B>ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/components.cif</B></a>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is a good idea to download it regularly to always have an
up-to-date copy.

<P>
Record the full path and filename of the Het Group Dictionary here so
that the programs know where to find it. If you have a ligand that is
not in the dictionary, you can define the ligand in your own version
of the dictionary or in a <B>.sdf</B> file (see below).

<P>
<B>SDF Dictionary.</B> If your ligand definitions are in a <B>.sdf</B>
file, you can provide the name of your file here in place of the Het
Group Dictionary. There are two important considerations:

<OL>
<LI> The file must have a <B>.sdf</B> extension.
<LI> The 3-character "residue name" of the ligand, as it appears in
your PDB file(s), must be given in the molecule's description. For
example:<BR>

<font color=green><B>&gt; &lt;PDB_HET_ID&gt;<BR>
PLP
</B></font>
</OL>

The exact name of the field (in this case "PDB_HET_ID") is not
important as different people will use different conventions. The
program will look for potential identifiers and, if they match one of
the Het Group names in the PDB file will take the corresponding
molecule definition.

<P>
<B>iii. Temporary directory</B><BR>

LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> needs a directory where it can put its temporary
working files (which it deletes once it has done with them). Use this
parameter to define such a directory. The directory must be present
on your computer and have write permissions that allow you to write to
it.

<P>
The default location for <B>Windows</B>
is <font color=green><B>C:\tmp</B></font>, and for <B>linux</B>
<font color=green><B>/tmp</B></font>. If these directories do not
exist on your system, you need to either create them or change the
path to directories that do exist.

<P>
<B>iv. Name of RasMol executable</B><BR>

Enter the full path and name of the RasMol executable file. This will
allow you to display the 3D coords of the given LIGPLOT/DIMPLOT
diagrams. If you do not have RasMol, enter <font
color=green><B>NONE</B></font> here, although it is recommended that
you download and install a copy of the program.

<P>
Linux users might find it more convenient to enter the RasMol path using
the following format:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color=green><B>xterm -e rasmol -script</B></font>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This will open up an X-term window as well as a RasMol window. The former
can be used for entering RasMol commands.

<P>
<B>v. Name of PyMOL executable</B><BR>

Similarly, if you have PyMOL installed, enter the full path and name
of the executable here. As in the RasMol option, this will allow you
to display the 3D coords of the given LIGPLOT/DIMPLOT
diagrams. If you do not have PyMOL,
enter <font color=green><B>NONE</B></font> here. 

<P>
<B>Save.</B><BR>

Once you have entered all the parameters, press
the <B>Save</B> button to store your paths. Should you need to
alter the paths at some later date, you can do so via the <B>Program
paths</B> menu item in the <B>Edit</B> menu:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="paths_select.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<h3>3. Generating a LIGPLOT/DIMPLOT/Antibody diagram</h3>

To generate a new diagram, select the PDB file of interest
using <font color=blue><B>File-Open-PDB file</B></font> from the menu
bar.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="open_pdb.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>
   <img src="enter_pdbcode.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

Enter the 4-character PDB code into the dialogue window that pops
up. The program will search for the PDB file using the location templates
defined in your <b>Paths and Directories</b> parameters described
above. The search order is the same as the order of the templates.

<P>
Alternatively, you can click the
browse <font color=blue><B>Browse</B></font> button for a PDB file in
your local directory system.

<P>
When the file has been loaded, you will see a summary of the ligands
and metals in the PDB file, if any, as shown below for PDB
entry <B>1a95</B>.

<P>
Clicking on the LIGPLOT, DIMPLOT or Antibody tabs allows you to choose
which of the programs is to run.

<P>
<ul>
<P><li><B>LIGPLOT</B>
 <ol>
<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="ligplot_tab.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
  <li>Select which ligand you wish to plot from the list.

<P>
Alternatively, you can enter your own residue range in the "<B>residue
range</B>" box. The residue range can be one of the following:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <U><I>Example</I></U>
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>
   <U><I>Description</I></U>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <B>18&nbsp;20&nbsp;A</B>
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   Residue range: start-residue-no. end-residue-no. chain-id<BR>
   If the chain-id is blank in the PDB file it should be omitted here
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <B>NAG&nbsp;18&nbsp;MAN&nbsp;20&nbsp;A</B>
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   Residue names and numbers, plus chain id.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <B>-n818&nbsp;108&nbsp;-n818&nbsp;108&nbsp;A</B>
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   Where the residue name is numeric, prefix it with "-n" to indicate
   that it is the residue name rather than the residue number.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <B>"MTE"&nbsp;1&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;G"&nbsp;2&nbsp;B</B>
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   Where a residue name includes leading blanks (eg as in the old
   definition of the nucleic acid bases, A, C, G and T), enclose it in
   quotes and include the spaces.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <B>"-nMTE"&nbsp;1&nbsp;"-n&nbsp;&nbsp;G"&nbsp;2&nbsp;B</B>
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   An alternative for the case above.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

  <li>To include waters on the plot, tick the checkbox next to the
      "<B>Include waters</B>" option.

<P>
  <li>Tick the "<B>Filter waters</B>" checkbox to only include waters that
      make at least 2 H-bonds to the ligand or form a bridge between
      ligand and protein. This removes waters that interact only with
      another water, or with just the protein.

  </ol>

<P>
<li><B>DIMPLOT</B>
 <ol>

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="dimplot_tab.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
  <li>
Select from the box on the left which pair of protein chains you would
like plotted.

<P>
Alternatively, you can define the two chains (or domains) by
entering their residue ranges into the two field-boxes
labelled "<B>Domain 1</B>" and "<B>Domain 2</B>" on the right.

<P>
Each residue range should be entered as: <B>n1-n2&nbsp;C</B>,
where <B>n1</B> is the start residue number, <B>n2</B> is the end
residue number, and <B>C</B> is the chain id.

<P>
If a domain is split into several residue ranges, you need to list
them all, separating each range by an ampersand. For example, a
domain comprising residues <B>1</B> to <B>136</B> and <B>338</B>
to <B>371</B> of chain <B>A</B>, would be defined as:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>1-136 A & 338-371 A</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

  A domain can consist of residue ranges from more than one chain.

<P>
  To define a whole chain, prefix the chain-id with an asterisk,
  eg <B>*A</B>. So, for example, to plot the interface between
  chains <B>A</B> and <B>B</B>, you could enter:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   Domain 1:
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>
   <B>*A</B>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
   Domain 2:
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>
   <B>*B</B>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


  <li>To include waters on the plot, tick the checkbox next to the
      "<B>Include waters</B>" option.

  <li>If you want the sequence order of the first chain/domain to be
  retained in the final plot, click the "<B>Retain sequence order of
  first chain/domain</B>" checkbox.

  <li>You can change whether the interface is shown horizontally
  (<B>Landscape</B> button) or vertically (<B>Portrait</B> button).
  </ol>

<P>
<li><B>Antibody plots</B>
 <ol>

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <img src="antibody_tab.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
  <li>Enter the single-character chain identifiers for the antibody
  heavy and light chains, and the antigen.

  <P>
  If the PDB file contains chains <B>H</B> and <B>L</B>, the program
  will suggest these to be the heavy and light chains,
  respectively. If it finds a third chain that interacts with both
  chains <B>H</B> and <B>L</B> it will suggest it as the antigen.

   <li>Select the antibody loop numbering scheme to be used defining
   which residues belong to each of the three heavy-chain loops
   - <B>H1</B>, <B>H2</B>, <B>H3</B> - and which to the three
   light-chain loops - <B>L1</B>, <B>L2</B>, <B>L3</B>. Each loop has
   a different colour on the plot to make it easier to identify.

   <P>
   The "Other" option will not assign residues to loops and will not
   given them different colours. You can still assign unique colours
   to single residues, or groups of residues, as described in section
   <i>4g</i> below.

   <li>Select the "<B>Include waters</B>" option, if required.

   <P>
   <li>You can change whether the interface is shown horizontally
   (<B>Landscape</B> button) or vertically (<B>Portrait</B> button).
  </ol>
</ul>

<P>
Then, to generate the plot, click on the <font color=blue><B>Run</B></font>
button.

<P>
<B>i. LIGPLOT</B>

<P>
When the plot has been generated it will appear on screen as shown below. This
shows the <B>PCP 301</B> ligand in PDB entry <B>1a95</B>.

<P>
<img src="ligplot_1a95.gif">

<P>
<B>Key</B>

<P>
The meaning of the items on the plot is as follows:

<P>
<img src="key.gif">

<P>
You can change colours, sizes, etc as described later.

<P>
Sometimes a plot contains thin purple lines. These are either covalent
bonds between protein and ligand, or "elastic" bonds within the
ligand. The latter occur when the ligand is a cyclic peptide; the
program has to make one of the bonds "elastic" in order to be able to
flatten the ligand into 2D.

<P>
<B>ii. DIMPLOT</B>

<P>
A <B>DIMPLOT</B> diagram will show the interactions across an interface, as
shown below for chains <B>A</B> and <B>C</B> in PDB entry <B>1n8z</B>.

<P>
<a href="dimplot_1n8z.gif"><img
 border=0 src="dimplot_1n8z_sm.gif"></a>

<P>
The horizontal dashed line represents the interface. It can be moved
up and down; its left and right ends adjust automatically according to
the positions of the leftmost and rightmost residues.

<P>
<B>iii. Antibody plot</B>

<P>
Below is an example of an antibody plot for PDB entry <B>1bj1</B>.

<P>
<a href="antibody_1bj1.gif"><img
 border=0 src="antibody_1bj1_sm.gif"></a>

<P>
The residues below the dashed line correspond to the antibody
loops. They are in sequence order and are coloured according to the
loop they belong to (usingthe Kabat numbering scheme). The residues of
the antigen are shown in pink above the line. Antibody loops L1 and L2
do not interact with the antigen, and so are not shown.


<h3>4. Editing the plot</h3>

<h3>a. Moving residues, atoms, and text items</h3>

To move any object on the plot just click and drag it using the left
mouse button.

<P>
Note, that to switch between moving whole residues and single atoms click
the <font color=blue><B>Move residue/move atom</B></font> button at
the bottom-right of the frame to toggle between the two modes.
<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="moveres_button.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="moveat_button.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
Hydrophobic contact groups cannot be moved in the
<font color=blue><B>Move atom</B></font> mode.

<h3>b. Panning and zooming</h3>

Use the left mouse button to click-and-drag on any blank area of the
plot to pan around the plot.
<P>
Use the right mouse button to click-and-drag on any blank area of the
plot to zoom in and out of the plot.
<P>
<B>Note for mac users.</B> If your mouse only has a single button, use
the SHIFT key with your button-click to get the same functionality as
a right button click.


<h3>c. Recentre</h3>

You can recentre the plot at any time by clicking on the <font
color=blue><B>Recentre</B></font> button at the bottom left of the
LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> window.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="recentre_button.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<h3>d. Rotating residues</h3>

You can rotate a residue about any of its atoms by right-clicking on
the atom you want to pivot about. A marker will appear
over the selected atom to identify it.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="rotate_res1.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="rotate_res2.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
To rotate, click-and-drag any other atom in the residue. Release the
button when you have reached the desired position.

<P>
To deselect the atom, click on any blank part of the plot, or on any
other residue.

<h3>e. Flipping about a bond</h3>

You can flip a residue, or part or a residue, about any of its bonds.
<P>
Firstly, select the bond by clicking on it with the right
mouse button. A marker will appear over the selected bond.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="flip_res1.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="flip_res2.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
To flip about this bond, click with the left mouse-button on any
atom on the side of the residue to be flipped. A single click will
perform the flip. Clicking a second time on any of the flipped atoms
will reverse the flip.
<P>
To "unselect" the flip-bond, click on any blank area of the plot and
the marker will disappear.

<h3>f. Editing text labels</h3>

You can edit any of the text labels on the plot.
<P>

Select the text item by right-clicking on it. A box containing the
text string will appear. You can edit the text as required. Click the
<font color=blue><B>OK</B></font> button to accept the new version, or
the <font color=blue><B>Cancel</B></font> button to retain the
previous text label.

<P>
You can use this option to remove any text labels: just delete the
text in the box. However, what if you have done this by accident, or
want to reinstate a previously deleted label? There is no longer
anything to click on! The solution is to click
the <font color=blue><B>On/off</B></font> button (described below) and
select the "<B>Show blank labels as hyphens</B>" checkbox. The missing
labels should now be visible as hyphens and clickable.

<h3>g. Colouring individual residues or groups of residues</h3>

You can select and uniquely colour individual residues, or groups of
residues, by changing the <font color=blue><B>Move residue</B></font> button at
the bottom-right of the frame to <font color=blue><B>Select residues</B></font>.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="selectres_button.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
Whenever you click a residue in this mode, one or more green ticks
will appear to show it has ben selected. Clicking the same residue a
second time unselects it and removes the ticks.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <a href="selected.gif"><img
    border=0 src="selected_sm.gif"></a>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
To change the colours of the bonds or labels of the selected
residues, click the <img src="edit_button.gif"> button and the
colours panel will pop up:

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="selectres_colours_dialogue.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
Choose the colours as required. They will be applied to the selected
residues, overriding their current ones. To revert to the originals,
click <font color=blue><B>Use defaults</B></font>.


<h3>5. Multiple plots</h3>

You can generate several related LIGPLOT/DIMPLOT/Antibody plots, one
after another, and the program will endeavour to overlay them as best
it can.

<P>
For example, you might wish to plot several structures of the same
protein with a different ligand bound. Or similar proteins with the
same or similar ligands bound. Alternatively, it might be useful to
see the interactions the same ligand makes when binding to completely
different proteins.

<P>
After the plots have been generated and overlaid, you can edit them by
moving their components independently and switching between them. The
currently active plot is shown in full colour in the foreground, while
all background plots are greyed out. Before printing you can "switch
off" the display of the background plots such that only the foreground
plot appears. This allows you to produce a set of clean plots with
equivalent components in equivalent positions on them. Alternatively,
if you use the "Write PostScript" option, you can have each plot
printed on a separate page.

<P>
The first plot is generated in the usual way. Each subsequent plot is
fitted to the first by a sequence alignment between the two proteins
(in the case of LIGPLOT) or between the first chains/domains (in the
case of DIMPLOT/Antibody plot). The alignment identifies equivalent
residues in the 3D structures and these equivalences drive the
generation of the second LIGPLOT/DIMPLOT/Antibody plot.

<P>
For LIGPLOT, if the program is unable to successfully align the
sequences, it tries to fit the ligands using a graph matching
procedure. For very distantly related proteins it is better to use a
structural alignment. Section 7 describes how to import such an
alignment.

<h3>a. Loading additional plots</h3>

In the simplest case, additional plots are loaded/generated in the
same way as the initial plot was. Use
either <font color=blue><B>File-Add</B></font>
or <font color=blue><B>File-Open-PDB file</B></font> to fit a new
LIGPLOT/DIMPLOT/Antibody plot on top of the current one on screen.


<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="add_replace.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
The new plot, when generated, will become the foreground plot; any
current plot(s) will go into the background.

<P>
In the example below, the left-hand plot shows the interactions
between guanine 600 in PDB entry 2pwu and the protein residues. The
right-hand plot shows, superposed on it, a plot of a similar molecule
(9DG) bound to the same protein, in PDB entry 1q2r. The red circles
and ellipses identify the residue on the latter plot that are
equivalent (in the 3D superposition of the structures) to the
underlying residues from the first plot.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="oneplot.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="two_plots.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> attempts, as best it can, to place
residues in the new plot on top of the equivalent residues in the old
one. It does this by first performing a simple sequence alignment
between the set of interacting residues from each structure. The
equivalenced residues in this alignment are then used to superpose the
3D coordinates from both PDB files. This may throw up more pairs of
equivalenced residues, being those that significantly overlap in the
superposition. The residue equivalences are then used to "drive" the
generation of the new LIGPLOT diagram; the 2D locations
from the first plot restrain the positions of the corresponding
residues in the second.

<P>
The superposition may not always be successful if either the two
proteins are quite different, or the second ligand is very large
relative to the first.

<P>
The "Split screen" button at the bottom of the frame separates the
two (or more) plots, and arranges them in the window.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="splitscreen_button.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
Two plots, as in the above example, are shown side by side:

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="split_plot.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
The "Merge back" button will restore the plots to overlap mode.

<P>
An alternative to the red ellipses for identifying equivalent residues
is shown below.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="split_plot_nocirc.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
Here, the equivalent residues have a red underlay beneath their bonds
and atoms. Equivalent residues engaged in hydrophobic interactions are
shown in thicker lines.

<P>
Use the <B>On/Off</B> parameters to switch between the circle and
underlay methods of depiction by checking/unchecking the 
"<B>Circle equivalent side chains</B>" and "<B>Highlight equivalent
side chains</B>" options, respectively.

<P>
<B>Inverting the highlights</B>

<P>
In some cases it might be useful to highlight the protein residues
that <i>differ</i> between the plots, rather than those that are
equivalent. Again, go to the <B>On/Off</B> parameters, this time
checking the "<B>Invert to highlight non-equivs instead</B>" option.


<h3>b. Moving any of the split plots relative to others</h3>

When the plots are in split-screen mode, as above, you can move one
plot relative to the other(s) by selecting the "Move plot" option from
the button at the bottom right of the screen:

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="moveplot_button.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
You can then move any of the plots on screen by clicking and dragging
any of their components (ie atoms, bonds, text items, etc). Remember
to revert to "Move residue" mode when you're done to return to normal
editing. When you merge the plots back, the "Move plot" option is lost.


<h3>c. Selecting the active plot</h3>

When the plots are merged, you can bring any of the background plots
to the foreground either by clicking on their greyed-out label in the
top right-hand corner, or by clicking on any of their greyed-out
components in the plot itself (ie atoms, bonds, text items, etc).

<h3>d. Viewing structures in RasMol or PyMOL</h3>

If you have either <B>RasMol</B> or <B>PyMOL</B> installed, and have
defined the path to the program(s) in <B>Paths and Directories</B>
above (Section 2), then there will be a <B>RasMol</B> and/or
<B>PyMOL</B> button at the bottom of the frame.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="rasmol_button.gif">
  </td>
  <td><img height=1 width=20 src="1x1.gif"></td>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="pymol_button.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
Clicking on one of these buttons will pop up a <B>RasMol</B> or
<B>PyMOL</B> window containing the superposed ligands, in 3D, with
H-bonds added in cyan and atoms involved in non-bonded contacts
represented by dot surfaces (in RasMol) or transparent surfaces (in
PyMOL).

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="rasmol_2pwu_1q2r.gif">
  </td>
  <td><img height=1 width=20 src="1x1.gif"></td>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="pymol_2pwu_1q2r.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<h3>e. Switching off the background plots</h3>

For printing, you might wish to switch off the background plots. You
can do this either by choosing <font color=blue><B>Edit-On/off
selection</B></font> from the menu bar, or by clicking on the <font
color=blue><B>On/off</B></font> button at the bottom of the frame.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="onoff_select.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="onoff_button.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>
Then, deselect the <font color=blue><B>Show inactive plots</B></font>
option, circled in red below.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="onoff_dialogue_a.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<h3>6. Plot parameters</h3>

You can adjust a number of parameters that define the appearance of
the plot. These can be accessed either by using the <font
color=blue><B>Edit</B></font> option in the menu bar at the top of
the LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> window, or by clicking one of the buttons at the 
bottom left. These are shown in the table below.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="onoff_select.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="sizes_select.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="colours_select.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td colspan=6><img height=20 width=1 src="1x1.gif"></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="onoff_button.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="sizes_button.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="colours_button.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
If you have two or more plots overlaid, there is an extra checkbox
(see example on the left below) which allows you to apply the new
parameters to the currently selected plot only, or to all plots. Thus
you can, say, have the bonds or labels shown in a different colour in
each plot. The background parameters always apply to all plots.

<h3>a. On/off selection</h3>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="onoff_dialogue.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="onoff_dialogue_dim.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

The on/off selection dialogue allows you to switch various components
of the plot on or off. If the box is checked, that item is switched
on. The left-hand panel above shows the LIGPLOT options while
the right-hand panel contains the DIMPLOT and Antibody plot options.

<P>
The items are grouped into:
<font color=blue><B>Labels</B></font>,
<font color=blue><B>Atoms</B></font>,
<font color=blue><B>Bonds</B></font>
and
<font color=blue><B>Miscellaneous</B></font>.

<h3>b. Sizes selection</h3>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="sizes_dialogue.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="sizes_dialogue_dim.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

This dialogue allows you to alter the sizes of various objects on the
plot. The sizes are given in "&Aring;ngstr&ouml;ms" so as to relate
to the scale of the coordinates and bond lengths in the original
molecules.

<P>
The items are grouped into:
<font color=blue><B>Label sizes</B></font>,
<font color=blue><B>Atom and residue sizes</B></font>
and
<font color=blue><B>Bond widths</B></font>.

<P>
The left-hand panel above shows the LIGPLOT options while
the right-hand panel contains the DIMPLOT and Antibody plot options.

<h3>c. Colour selection</h3>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="colours_dialogue2.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="colours_dialogue_dim.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

This dialogue controls the colours of the objects on the plot. The
tabs give the colour selections for different item types:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color=blue><B>Background</B></font>,
<font color=blue><B>Labels</B></font>,
<font color=blue><B>Atoms</B></font>,
<font color=blue><B>Bonds</B></font>
and
<font color=blue><B>Antibodies</B></font>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The left-hand panel above shows
the <font color=blue><B>Labels</B></font> colour options for LIGPLOT
while the right-hand panel contains the corresponding DIMPLOT and
Antibody plot options.

<P>
Note that, for ligand and
non-ligand <font color=blue><B>Bonds</B></font> there is a special
extra colour labelled "ATOM". If this "colour" is selected, the bonds
will be coloured such that each half is of the colour of the atom
bonded at that end.

<P>
The <font color=blue><B>Antibodies</B></font> tab defines the colours
for each antibody loop when plotting antibody-antigen plots, as shown below.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="ab_colours_dialogue.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

The "<B>Others</B>" colour corresponds to antibody residues not
belonging to any of the loops.


<h3>7. Runtime parameters</h3>

The runtime parameters allow you to alter some of the parameters that
are used in generating the LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> diagrams. The
parameters are accessed from the <font color=blue><B>Edit</B></font>
option in the menu bar at the top of the LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> window.

<P>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="runtime_option.gif">
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td valign=top>
   <img src="runtime_params.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
The four numeric parameters relate to the <B>HBPLUS</B> program used by
LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> to compute all the potential hydrogen
bonds and non-bonded contacts. The first two values correspond to the
maximum hydrogen-acceptor and donor-acceptor distances for defining
what is a hydrogen bond. By increasing these values you can "bring in"
additional interactions which may be just outside the program's
criteria for an H-bond.

<P>
The next two numeric parameters correspond to the range of distances
defining non-bonded contacts (ie contacts between atoms that are
neither covalently bonded, nor interacting via hydrogen bonds). The
default range is 2.9-3.9 &Aring;

<P>
Below the numeric parameters are two groups of radio buttons. The
first set allows you to specify which atom-atom contacts are to be
included as non-bonded contacts: a) between hydrophobic atoms only (ie
C or S), b) between a hydrophobic atom and any other, or c) between
any type of atom.

<P>
The second group of radio buttons relates to the treatment of any
CONECT records that may be in your PDB file. The CONECT records define
which atoms are covalently bonded to one another. They are generally
used for defining the connectivity of the ligand. Sometimes, these
records are incorrect and give unfeasibly long bonds.

<P>
You can choose how the program should treat the CONECT records. The
default is to use them if they look sensible - that is, if they don't
give ridiculously long bond lengths. The second option is to ignore
these records altogether; the program will compute the ligand's
covalent bonds itself, using set distance cut-offs. The third option
is to accept all CONECT records, irrespective of the bond lengths
they give.

<h3>8. Adding missing H-bonds</h3>

The H-bonds and non-bonded contacts shown by <B>LIGPLOT</B> are
calculated by <b>HBPLUS</b>. Occasionally,
<b>HBPLUS</b> can miss an H-bond, particularly when it encounters a
ligand it does not recognize.

<P>
If you need your plot to have an H-bond that <b>HBPLUS</b> has missed, you can
add it as follows:

<OL>
<LI>Edit your PDB file and add the missing H-bonds, or non-bonded contacts,
as "<B>HHB</B>" and "<B>NNB</B>" records, respectively. These records
should come <i>before</i> the <B>ATOM</B> records in the file.

<P>
The format of each "<B>HHB</B>" or "<B>NNB</B>" record should be
formatted <i>exactly</i> as shown below, where the dots represent
blank spaces.

<PRE>
<B>Key   &lt;----Atom 1 --->     &lt;----Atom 2 --->    Dist</B>
<font color=blue><B>HHB...RRR.C.NNNNI.AAAA.....RRR.C.NNNNI.AAAA....DDDD</B></font>

<P>
Some example lines are given below:

<font color=blue><B>HHB   ALA A  113   N       PHQ A  317   O2     3.31</B></font>
</PRE>

<LI>After editing any required H-bonds or non-bonded contacts into your PDB
file, rerun LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> on this new PDB file.

</OL>

<h3>9. Removing unwanted H-bonds</h3>

To remove any unwanted H-bonds or non-bonded contacts from your plot,
follow the steps above, but annotating the unwanted bonds by
"<B>-HB</B>" and "<B>-NB</B>" records in your PDB file,
respectively. The value you put in the "<B>Dist</B>" is not important
and can be "<B>0.00</B>".

<P>
So, for example, to remove the H-bond between the
<b>NH<SUB>2</SUB></b> of
<b>Arg286(A)</b> and the <b>O7</b> of your ligand, <b>LIG1(B)</b>, you
would add the following line to your PDB file:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
<B>-HB...RRR.C.NNNNI.AAAA.....RRR.C.NNNNI.AAAA....DDDD</B>
<font color=blue><B>-HB   ARG A  286   NH2     LIG B    1   O7     0.00</B></font>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>10. Plots from structural alignments</h3>

For distantly related proteins it may be difficult for
LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> to reliably identify equivalent residues in the
binding sites. Thus an overlaid plot of two or more structures might
not give a good alignment.

<P>
One way to help the program is to supply it with a structural
alignment between the proteins, letting it know which residues are
equivalent in 3D.

<P>
At present, LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP> only accepts structural alignments in
the following formats:

<ul>
<li>CORA format (ie from the CATH team's CORA program)

<li>CAF format (also from the CATH team's CORA program)

<li>Multiple FASTA format

</ul>

The formats are described later.

<P>
<b>Import the alignment</b>

<P>
Import using <font color=blue><B>File-Import</B></font> from the menu bar.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="import.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

Locate the appropriate <B>.cora</B>, <B>.caf</B> or <B>.fasta</B> file
and Open it.

<P>
A pop-up window will show you the list of PDB codes in the file and
allow you to select which one you want to plot first.

<table>
 <tr>
  <td valign=bottom>
   <img src="cora_list.gif">
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<P>
After the first plot has been generated, you can add others on top of
it via either <font color=blue><B>File-Add</B></font>
or <font color=blue><B>File-Open-PDB file</B></font>.

<h3>11. Structural alignment file formats</h3>

The following are the structural alignment file formats currently
accepted by LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP>:

 <li>Header information - not used by LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP><BR>
  All-against-all structural similarity statistics.

 <li>The alignment given in chunks, with 2 lines per entry: the first
 gives the amino acid sequence of the protein and the second gives the
 secondary structure (which is not used by LigPlot<SUP>+</SUP>).

The key thing here is the format of the protein name line which must
take one of the following forms:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
>pdb|1z5a<BR>
>pdb|1z5aA<BR>
>pdb|1z5aA01<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

where "<B>A</B>" is the chain identifier and "<B>01</B>" is the domain
number.
